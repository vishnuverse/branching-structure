# Project Overview

This repository contains the codebase for [Project Name], a modular application with distinct verticals for machine learning, data engineering, frontend, and backend development. This README provides an overview, setup instructions, and guidelines for secrets management and development workflows.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into dedicated folders for modularity and separation of concerns:

- **/ml**: Machine learning code, models, and experiments (e.g., training scripts, Jupyter notebooks, model artifacts).
- **/data_engineering**: Data pipelines, ETL processes, and data processing scripts (e.g., Airflow DAGs, Spark jobs, SQL queries).
- **/frontend**: Frontend application code and assets (e.g., React/Vue/Angular components, CSS, static assets).
- **/backend**: Backend services and APIs (e.g., Node.js/Flask/Django applications, database migrations).
- **/docs**: Project documentation (e.g., architecture diagrams, API specifications).
- **/tests**: Test suites for all verticals, with subfolders `/ml`, `/data_engineering`, `/frontend`, `/backend`.
- **/scripts**: Utility scripts for automation and setup.
- **/config**: Configuration files for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
- **README.md**: This file, containing project overview and setup instructions.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - **Frontend** (e.g., React):
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - **Backend** (e.g., Node.js or Python):
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install  # For Node.js
     pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python
     ```
   - **Data Engineering/ML** (e.g., Python):
     ```bash
     cd data_engineering  # or ml
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the relevant directory (e.g., `/backend`, `/frontend`) based on `.env.example`.
   - Example `.env` file:
     ```plaintext
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
     API_KEY=your_api_key
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     node index.js  # For Node.js
     python app.py  # For Python
     ```
   - **Data Engineering/ML**:
     Refer to specific scripts or notebooks in `/data_engineering` or `/ml` for execution instructions.

## Secrets Management

Secrets are managed using environment variables or a secure vaulting tool (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault). Do **not** commit sensitive information to the repository.

### Example: Fetching Secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
```bash
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id my-app/dev --region us-east-1
```

### JavaScript Example (Node.js)
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const dbPassword = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
console.log(`Connecting to database with password: ${dbPassword}`);
```

### Python Example
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
db_password = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
print(f"Connecting to database with password: {db_password}")
```

## Branching Strategy

The project follows a Git workflow with the following branches:

- **main**: Source branch for all feature branches, always reflecting the latest stable code.
- **develop**: Integration branch for feature branches, triggers development environment deployment.
- **staging**: Pre-production branch for testing, triggers staging environment deployment.
- **production**: Production-ready branch, triggers production environment deployment.

### Branch Naming Conventions
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/<vertical>/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/frontend/login-ui`, `feature/ml/image-classifier`).
- **Bug Fixes**: `bugfix/<vertical>/<issue-id>-<description>` (e.g., `bugfix/frontend/123-login-crash`).
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/<vertical>/<description>` (e.g., `hotfix/backend/db-connection`).
- **Release Branches**: `release/<version>` (e.g., `release/v1.0.0`).

Use concise, lowercase, hyphen-separated descriptions. Avoid generic names like `feature/work`.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   - Branch off from `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull
     git checkout -b feature/<vertical>/<short-description>
     ```
   - Example: `git checkout -b feature/frontend/login-ui`

2. **Develop and Commit**:
   - Commit changes regularly with clear messages:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add login form component in frontend"
     ```

3. **Merge to Develop**:
   - Create a pull request (PR) to merge into `develop`.
   - Ensure tests and CI/CD pipelines pass.
   - Deployment to the development environment is triggered automatically.

4. **Test in Develop**:
   - Test the feature in the development environment.
   - If issues arise, create a new feature branch from `main` for fixes (e.g., `feature/frontend/login-fix`).

5. **Merge to Staging**:
   - Create a PR to merge `develop` into `staging`.
   - Run tests and ensure CI/CD passes.
   - Deployment to the staging environment is triggered automatically.

6. **Test in Staging**:
   - Perform integration and performance tests in the staging environment.
   - Create new feature branches from `main` for any fixes.

7. **Merge to Production**:
   - Create a PR to merge `staging` into `production`.
   - Run final checks and ensure CI/CD passes.
   - Deployment to the production environment is triggered automatically.

8. **Sync Main**:
   - Periodically merge `production` back into `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge production
     ```

## Additional Guidelines

- **CI/CD**: Pipelines are configured to trigger deployments on pushes to `develop`, `staging`, and `production`.
- **Testing**: Write tests for each vertical and store them in `/tests` with matching subfolder structure (e.g., `/tests/frontend`).
- **Documentation**: Update `/docs` with relevant changes for each feature (e.g., API specs, architecture diagrams).
- **Code Reviews**: Require at least one reviewer for PRs to `develop`, `staging`, and `production`.
- **Vertical Isolation**: Minimize cross-vertical dependencies (e.g., backend APIs used by frontend).

## Contributing

1. Follow the branching strategy and naming conventions.
2. Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR.
3. Update documentation in `/docs` for significant changes.
4. Keep commits atomic and descriptive.
