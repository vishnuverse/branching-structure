Git Project Structure and Branching Strategy
This document outlines the folder structure, branching strategy, and workflow for the project, ensuring clear organization and deployment processes across development, staging, and production environments.
Folder Structure
The project is organized into dedicated folders for each vertical to maintain modularity and separation of concerns:
/ml: Machine Learning-related code, models, and experiments.
Example: Model training scripts, Jupyter notebooks, model artifacts.
/data_engineering: Data pipelines, ETL processes, and data processing scripts.
Example: Airflow DAGs, Spark jobs, SQL queries.
/frontend: Frontend application code and assets.
Example: React/Vue/Angular components, CSS, static assets.
/backend: Backend services and APIs.
Example: Node.js/Flask/Django applications, database migrations.
/docs: Project documentation.
Example: Architecture diagrams, API specs.
/tests: Test suites for all verticals.
Subfolders: /ml, /data_engineering, /frontend, /backend.
/scripts: Utility scripts for automation and setup.
/config: Configuration files for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
README.md: Project overview, setup instructions, and secrets management.
Branching Strategy
The project follows a Git workflow with feature branches and three main branches that trigger deployments:
main: The source branch for all feature branches. Always reflects the latest stable code.
develop: Integration branch for feature branches. Triggers development environment deployment.
staging: Pre-production branch for testing. Triggers staging environment deployment.
production: Production-ready branch. Triggers production environment deployment.
Workflow
Create a Feature Branch:


Always branch off from main.
Name feature branches using the format: feature/<vertical>/<short-description>.
Examples:
feature/frontend/login-ui (Frontend login interface).
feature/ml/image-classifier (ML image classification model).
feature/backend/user-api (Backend user API endpoint).
feature/data_engineering/sales-pipeline (Data pipeline for sales data).
Keep descriptions concise, lowercase, and use hyphens (no spaces or underscores).
Development:


Commit changes to the feature branch regularly with clear messages.
Example: git commit -m "Add login form component in frontend".
Merge to Develop:


Once the feature is complete, create a pull request (PR) to merge the feature branch into develop.
Run tests and ensure CI/CD passes.
Example: Merge feature/frontend/login-ui into develop.
Deployment to the development environment is triggered automatically.
Test in Develop:


Test the feature in the development environment.
If issues are found, create a new feature branch from main to fix them (e.g., feature/frontend/login-fix).
Merge to Staging:


After successful testing in develop, create a PR to merge develop into staging.
Run tests and ensure CI/CD passes.
Deployment to the staging environment is triggered automatically.
Test in Staging:


Perform thorough testing in the staging environment (e.g., integration, performance tests).
If issues arise, create a new feature branch from main for fixes.
Merge to Production:


After successful staging tests, create a PR to merge staging into production.
Run final checks and ensure CI/CD passes.
Deployment to the production environment is triggered automatically.
Sync Main:


After production deployment, periodically merge production back into main to keep `main up-to-date.
Example: git merge production main.
Branch Naming Rules
Feature Branches: feature/<vertical>/<short-description>.
<vertical>: One of frontend, backend, data_engineering, ml.
<short-description>: Concise, lowercase, hyphen-separated.
Examples: feature/backend/auth-endpoint, feature/ml/model-tuning tuning.
Bug Fixes: bugfix/<vertical-name>/<issue-id>-<description> (e.g., bugfix/frontend/123-login-crash).
Hotfixes: hotfix/<vertical>/<description> for urgent production issues (e.g., hotfix/backend/db-connection).
Release Branches: release/<version> (e.g., release/v1.0.0).
Avoid generic names (e.g., feature/work, feature/update).
Use issue IDs for bug fixes if applicable.
README Content
The README.md includes setup instructions, project overview, and secrets management commands.
Secrets Management
Secrets are managed using environment variables or a secure vaulting tool (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault,). Below are example commands to retrieve secrets for development.
JavaScript Example (Node.js))
javascript
// .env file (not committed)
require('dotenv').config();

const dbPassword = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
console.log(`Connecting to database with password: ${dbPassword}`);

Python Example
python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
db_password = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
print(f"Connecting to database with password: {db_password}")

Secrets Command
bash
# Example: Fetch secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id my-app/dev --region us-east-1

Additional Notes
CI/CD: Ensure pipelines are configured to trigger deployments on pushes to develop, staging, and production.
Testing: Write tests for each vertical and store them in the /tests folder with matching subfolder structure.
Documentation: Update /docs with relevant changes for each feature.
Code Reviews: Require at least one reviewer for PRs to develop, staging, and production.
Vertical Isolation: Avoid cross-vertical dependencies unless absolutely necessary (e.g., backend APIs used by frontend).
This structure and workflow ensure a scalable, organized, and reliable development process across all project verticals.
