Project Overview
This repository contains the codebase for [Project Name], a modular application with distinct verticals for machine learning, data engineering, frontend, and backend development. This README provides an overview, setup instructions, and guidelines for secrets management and development workflows.
Folder Structure
The project is organized into dedicated folders for modularity and separation of concerns:

/ml: Machine learning code, models, and experiments (e.g., training scripts, Jupyter notebooks, model artifacts).
/data_engineering: Data pipelines, ETL processes, and data processing scripts (e.g., Airflow DAGs, Spark jobs, SQL queries).
/frontend: Frontend application code and assets (e.g., React/Vue/Angular components, CSS, static assets).
/backend: Backend services and APIs (e.g., Node.js/Flask/Django applications, database migrations).
/docs: Project documentation (e.g., architecture diagrams, API specifications).
/tests: Test suites for all verticals, with subfolders /ml, /data_engineering, /frontend, /backend.
/scripts: Utility scripts for automation and setup.
/config: Configuration files for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
README.md: This file, containing project overview and setup instructions.

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>


Install Dependencies:

Frontend (e.g., React):cd frontend
npm install


Backend (e.g., Node.js or Python):cd backend
npm install  # For Node.js
pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python


Data Engineering/ML (e.g., Python):cd data_engineering  # or ml
pip install -r requirements.txt




Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the relevant directory (e.g., /backend, /frontend) based on .env.example.
Example .env file:DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
API_KEY=your_api_key




Run the Application:

Frontend:cd frontend
npm start


Backend:cd backend
node index.js  # For Node.js
python app.py  # For Python


Data Engineering/ML:Refer to specific scripts or notebooks in /data_engineering or /ml for execution instructions.



Secrets Management
Secrets are managed using environment variables or a secure vaulting tool (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault). Do not commit sensitive information to the repository.
Example: Fetching Secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id my-app/dev --region us-east-1

JavaScript Example (Node.js)
require('dotenv').config();
const dbPassword = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
console.log(`Connecting to database with password: ${dbPassword}`);

Python Example
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
db_password = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
print(f"Connecting to database with password: {db_password}")

Branching Strategy
The project follows a Git workflow with the following branches:

main: Source branch for all feature branches, always reflecting the latest stable code.
develop: Integration branch for feature branches, triggers development environment deployment.
staging: Pre-production branch for testing, triggers staging environment deployment.
production: Production-ready branch, triggers production environment deployment.

Branch Naming Conventions

Feature Branches: feature/<vertical>/<short-description> (e.g., feature/frontend/login-ui, feature/ml/image-classifier).
Bug Fixes: bugfix/<vertical>/<issue-id>-<description> (e.g., bugfix/frontend/123-login-crash).
Hotfixes: hotfix/<vertical>/<description> (e.g., hotfix/backend/db-connection).
Release Branches: release/<version> (e.g., release/v1.0.0).

Use concise, lowercase, hyphen-separated descriptions. Avoid generic names like feature/work.
Development Workflow

Create a Feature Branch:

Branch off from main:git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/<vertical>/<short-description>


Example: git checkout -b feature/frontend/login-ui


Develop and Commit:

Commit changes regularly with clear messages:git commit -m "Add login form component in frontend"




Merge to Develop:

Create a pull request (PR) to merge into develop.
Ensure tests and CI/CD pipelines pass.
Deployment to the development environment is triggered automatically.


Test in Develop:

Test the feature in the development environment.
If issues arise, create a new feature branch from main for fixes (e.g., feature/frontend/login-fix).


Merge to Staging:

Create a PR to merge develop into staging.
Run tests and ensure CI/CD passes.
Deployment to the staging environment is triggered automatically.


Test in Staging:

Perform integration and performance tests in the staging environment.
Create new feature branches from main for any fixes.


Merge to Production:

Create a PR to merge staging into production.
Run final checks and ensure CI/CD passes.
Deployment to the production environment is triggered automatically.


Sync Main:

Periodically merge production back into main:git checkout main
git merge production





Additional Guidelines

CI/CD: Pipelines are configured to trigger deployments on pushes to develop, staging, and production.
Testing: Write tests for each vertical and store them in /tests with matching subfolder structure (e.g., /tests/frontend).
Documentation: Update /docs with relevant changes for each feature (e.g., API specs, architecture diagrams).
Code Reviews: Require at least one reviewer for PRs to develop, staging, and production.
Vertical Isolation: Minimize cross-vertical dependencies (e.g., backend APIs used by frontend).

Contributing

Follow the branching strategy and naming conventions.
Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR.
Update documentation in /docs for significant changes.
Keep commits atomic and descriptive.

For questions or issues, contact the project maintainers or open an issue in the repository.
